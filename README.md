Design concept
--------------

The visual identity embodies the spirit of the fediverse and hacker culture
through several symbolic elements:

 -  *Cat motif*: Represents the curious and independent nature of developers and
    hackers, who have long embraced cats as their cultural mascot
 -  *Star-shaped mouth*: Symbolizes the fediverse (federated universe) concept,
    reflecting ActivityPub's decentralized network topology
 -  *Orbital ring*: The circular element around the cat's neck evokes cosmic
    imagery, reinforcing the "universe" theme while suggesting connectivity and
    orbital dynamics
 -  *Minimalist design*: Clean geometric forms ensure versatility across
    platforms while maintaining strong brand recognition

The design captures the essence of a developer community that values
exploration, curiosity, and interconnectedness within the decentralized web.
